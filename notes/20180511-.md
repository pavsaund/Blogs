The Heart to Start

Notes from the Book by David Kadavy.

David has opened up himself and his perspective to his art. He shares his reflections on his art, and break down his thout process. Creating art is not a traiht forward process, and understanding this is one of the most difficukt things I have experienced. On the one hand it makes complete logical sense that the creative process is "messy". There is a lack of structue to creating the art, no matter how much we try. On the other hand, recognizing that when you are in the middle of that creation is extremely difficult. It's something that I have struggled with many times, and even though I've pulled through with something unique on the other side, I've been completely emotioanally and mentally drained. Perhaps even so drained that I couldn't celebrate the achievement of creating something only I could have done.

What David has done in this book is taking a step back from the messyness of creating, and put emotions into perspective. The book is broken down into three sections : The Laws of Art, Finding the Fuel and Winning by Beginning.
