Ask questions - don't question.
This is something that Gregory brown (@practicingdev) shared with me on twitter when I was quite honest and open about some things I was going through. He responded with a tweet sayign he hard head this distinction. Where you can Ask questions or you can question. Where Asking questions is helpful and productive, and questioning is adversarial in nature.

Now, to dig deeper into what triggered this response from my side, maybe it makes sense to dig into the situation it arose in. So we were being presented a solution that was going to be implemented in and by another team. On our end we were responsible for a small part of that work, and mostly were needed as a supportive facilitator. In my mind it's natural for me to start to ask questions in regards to the "why" to understand how this can possible be improved. I had then put my own user perspective onto this solution and found it confusing (without really testing anything - just reflecting). Then the rest of the session became about my judgement and opinion. I asked leading questions to figure out how we could improve this solution. I didn't ask other - more open questions like "what is the actual work on our side" - Someone on our team has been involved and has been through all of this and had good answers but I wasn't listening. At this point there were 2 of us that had had the same thoughts. The thing is, the thoughts weren't wrong, they had just been hashed through many times before. In the end I started to dig into a hole with someone else in the team, and we agreed this could be improved. When we finally reached out to someone who had more back-story we understood more of the facts and limitations. There were many things involved in this, and I think this is where my judgement kicked in. So trying tp break my judgement down:
 - My ego wanted to contribute to this solution personally - somehow get credit for making it simpler (this is something I do relatively well by taking a step back)
 - I was skeptical to the person presenting this solution - they had presented something else to me once before and had missed the mark (as I saw it)
 - I was skeptical to the solution itself and that we couldn't go down a better path 
 - I was skeptical about how the other team estimated this would be a lot more work and I couldn't understand how this could be the case.
 - I was skeptical about how the company had decided to prioritize work given the "project budget"-definition and not looking at the bigger picture and what would be "good for the customer" aka my own world view.
 - I was skeptical to how the team hadn't been involved at an earlier stage.

 I was coming from a good place. I wanted to contribute to a better user experience for the end customers. I wanted to be proud to have contributed in some way to this solution. I wanted us as a department to shine.

 As I spoke to my own team mate that had been involved I finally started to listen to the answers, and things started to make sense. A lot of my arguments were completely contradicting other beliefs I held dear to me.

 - on Ego: Wanting the team to have a good solution is awesome - it's focusing on what the outcome. Focusing on my perspective (alone) is selfish. My view is important, but understanding when my view isn't the best solution and not being able to sell it means I need to reflect and understand more. What am I missing? 
  - *Can I understand WHY they have come to this conclusion? (this is what I did in the end)*
 
 - on the person presenting: I had let a single incident shape my expectations of this persons abilities and priorities. This is wrong on so many levels. 
   - the incident was when they had just started
   - I truly believe that people improve by making mistakes and learning for themselves
   - This was not my primary area of expertise. 
   - This person had worked on the problem A LOT longer than I had

 - on the solution - everyone in the meeting agreed that this wasn't the best solution - so that in itself should have been a signal that people have pushed for something better and had boiled it down to what was presented. 
  - *This is natural to ask about, discover, accept and move on.*
 
 - on company / project / priorities - wtf. These things are completely out of scope. It's completely irrelevant. I don't decide what gets prioritized, nor what to spend money on. I have some domain knowledge, but I'm not a domain expert. This is just bullshit. It's so far out of my circle of concern and influence that there should have been large STOP signs whacking me on my head.
  - *just don't*

 - on other teams estimation - Trust, man. TRUST. They are the team that needs to do this. They are responsible for estimating and being responsible for their part of the solution. I can ask questions as to where the limitations are, just to verify I also understand enough, then I can be quiet.

 - on not being involved - COME ON! When I'm not involved earlier? this is my ego talking again. But also, on a much more practical level this means being part of more plannings and meetings. Which would have removed me from doing other more important work. Which would also have meant more cognitive load by needing to flex my creative muscles in many directions and worse quality of work by everyone.
  - There is something to be said here when it comes to WIP limits across our organization, but also completely out of scope
  - Also something to be said about how information flows - completely out of scope
  - *Appreciate the work that has gone into this and how people have tried to involve others in a good way. See potential process improvements and bring these up*
 
OK - SHIT! that was a lot of text. I wonder if there's a blog post in there somewhere?
