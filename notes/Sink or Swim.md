# Sink or Swim: On-boarding or walking the plank for a new developer

In my first days as an employee as a "Systems Developer", that was my title, I was in awe. I had landed a job as a programmer and I was being paid to work as a professional programmer! Over the first weeks or so I was introduced to the company the products, and the project I was to be working on. A young, naive person ready to take on any challenge! I was introduced to the project I was to be working on and I gladly accepted the challenge!

I learned that the project had been planned and sold as a bid to a huge multi-supplier contract 2 years ago, and they had just been accepted as the winner! Meaning initial money and funding was on it's way in. The planned go-live was in approximately 2 years time, which is when the first bombshell dropped. We needed to be ready for the first Acceptance tests in 6 months. I was given responsibility for being a "project technical guy", and also assigned the responsibility of developing a custom backend service, which was mission critical. Perhaps it's really relevant to mention that I had zero programming experience. So, from book after book after book I managed to piece together the first working version of the service. I had made it, and was ready for the acceptance test.

This is when I first experienced the term "It works on my machine!". Needles to say, things went badly. It was a blow to my confidence, but I pulled an all-nighter, traced the logs and made it work the next day. This happened for the next acceptance tests, a month or so later. Where I learned what a load balancer was. Then when we were placed in the actual network zone, and I learned what a firewall was.

This was more or less my first year or so. Constant failing, and constant learning.

It sounds like things went pretty well, right? Well, in some ways yes, in other ways...no.

Fast forward to the next contract. I now have 2 yrs experience (approx 6 months was dedicated to programming), and I'm assigned to another project due in 6 months. This time A LOT bigger. I also get another developer with me on this project. He's as new to this as I was when I started. After 6 months of slogging, failing and going through the same acceptance rituals we deliver a working solution that ends up meeting the needs of the project.

Within the next few months, I quit.

Does any of this sound familiar? Have you experienced being thrown out into the deep and having no choice but to sink or swim? I'm guessing you have, and I'm also guessing you have mixed feelings about that experience. It's an on-boarding ritual that more or less says "we don't know how to train you, so here's something you can do...go make it work".

Reflecting back on that time, I realize that there was some support from other junior devs, but little to no support from any senior devs. All of the senior devs were actually working on the platform team, and weren't part of the projects. It's scary to think that my career could have gone a completely different direction from that point.

Luckily I joined a new company, with a team of people open to discussing, learning and arguing (mostly healthily). But that's a story for another day.

How have your first experiences with programming been? Have you been accepted with open arms, guided and mentored? Have you also experienced a "sink or swim" mentality? Did you swim or sink?
