Some rough thoughts on starting to build a Line of Business software product.

## The process of building a product
- Building great products means different things to different people.
- It does not mean getting it right the first time
- It does mean getting to a shared understanding of what the product means to the people using it, and their needs
- It's taking a vague idea or concept from a product owners head and gradually making sense of that idea as builders.
- It means rebounding that idea off current and potential users and allowing it to evolve along the way based on their feedback.
- Doing so by building out the product in unpolished iterations. Mockups, Prototypes, Proof of Concepts, Actual Products.

## Don't make it look shiny right away
- Polishing the product is often the enemy. It's where most of the time goes.
- The problem with too much polish in the beginning is that it's just another form of "premature optimization". You don't know if you're building the right thing. Building it right is important, but building it wonderful should be done when you are (more) confident it's the right thing. 
- At the same time, you need to show some polish so the product feels real enough for people to give actual feedback. A bare minimum of styling and perhaps even behaviour around user feedback (information / error mesages / validation etc).

## Make it feel right first
- With each iteration the look and feel of the product gradually improves. From being something rough, unfinished, barely functioning. Into a product that flows (hopefully). A product that users understand and appreciate, as it focuses on allowing them to get their work done.
- Initially these iterations can feel counter-productive. You see the product development isn't moving fast. 
- What's happening under the hood though is the project scope / vision starts to make its way into everyones heads. It solidifies and as this happens things start to change and the product starts to evolve.

## Feedback Loops 
- As the product starts to take form, you'll need to gain more feedback to validate the direction from the team doing development, stakeholders and users. 
- To complete this loop, you need to get the initial version of the application to a state where you can actualy do a logical part of someones job. Meet a small need and get this in front of real users to gather feedback an initial thoughts.
- Initially this can be done with simple wireframes and mockups. Iterating on this to create nicer prototypes until you have a good idea of where to start.
- From that jump straight into creating the application with the bare minimum to make it work.
- Ideally you should be feeling embarrassed about presenting the software like this. That's completely fine. User's feedback will guide you towards prioritising the next iteration. It will also confirm if you're heading in the right direction.
- Feedback from 3-5 people at each iteration should start to reveal the major pain-points that need to be adressed, and that should sail up the priority list.

## Make it delightful
- As you attend the needs of users, you'll start to get more and more personal / nuanced feedback. At this point you'll start to have a good idea of how the flow of the application should be, and how users expect it to work. 
- Now is the time to make the application a delight to use. Polish rough edges and look for ways to make users' lives easier.
- Look for ways of turning up what's already working.

## Caveats
- When someone is presented an application to get something done, they don't want to actually learn and use that application. They want to get that something done. Look for ways to optimize for the users and get out of their way.
- Nothing beats an application that pops up when it's needed, is easy to work with and goes away without any nagging when the user us done.
- Consistency and predictability are key factors



At the end of the day, at the very core of building a product is something vulnerable. Something that is fragile that must be nourished and grown. It's feedback loops all the way, and working towards functioning iterations that nudge the product forward and tend to needs of the users. You can't fit that into a fixed time or fixed budget. You can do the best you can with the resources you have in hand and get the product to a place where it can solve real needs.

As long as you're listening, you'll know when you can stop and move on. You'll also know when you need to revisit and iterate based on new needs. Be prepared for this. It's not until a product is in active use that underlying needs surface.
