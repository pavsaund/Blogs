# Discovering Empathy as a Software Developer
In a recent conversation I happened to mention the words "Discovering Empathy". Now this sparked a follow-up question about what that actually means. Now I didn't pay much thought into my wording before uttering those words, but the question caught me off-guard. This post is an attempt to break down those words.

I think many of you can relate to how you immersed yourself in technology as you entered your career's as software developers. It is what draws most of us in to the profession to begin with, after all. I certainly did. I pretty soon found myself enjoying how tools and techniques I learned could be put to use in creating wonderful user experiences.

This focus brought me to a mid-level developer stage. I was confident in the technology stack and preferred programming approach I knew of and was able to deliver efficiently. One day it all came crashing down, and I went through one of the hardest experiences in my career, and perhaps my life, when I hit the wall. Hard. [I experienced my first burnout](http://codingwithempathy.com/2016/04/12/my-personal-burnout-lessons-learned/) and had to figure out how to get back on my feet.

During my recovery from burnout is when I stumbled on the concept of empathy. It was while reading Marshal D. Rosenberg's wonderful [Non-Violent Communication](). The concept of empathy wasn't really anything new to me, but at the same time it wasn't on my radar either. I knew the word and concept and thought I had a grasp of what it meant, but I was mistaken.

I was drawn to the concept of empathy, and realized it's a trait I would like others to extend when they dealt with me. Which in turn meant that **I needed** to be able to show empathy for those around me. This led me to start blogging and learning about empathy. 

Looking back, I realize it wasn't something that came to me naturally. By keeping the concept present and near to me and writing about different aspects of how it related to software development, I see how I've slowly discovered empathy, and how it applied to me.

This discovery process hasn't been a straight-forward learning progression, like when learning a new programming language. It's been messy and with failures along the way. But I sit here and am convinced that my own capacity for showing and applying empathy has increased ever since I put it on my radar. And at the end of the day, it's so **SO** worth it!

So, perhaps it's time for you to discover empathy?
