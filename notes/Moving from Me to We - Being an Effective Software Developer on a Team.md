# Moving from ME to WE

> This is based on a presentation I held for the Developer On Fire Remote Conference.

We all dream of working on dream teams. Teams that seem to just get each other, work wonderfully together and finally crank out wonderful products that users love to use and companies willingly pay for.

This isn't the case for everyone though - A surprisingly high number of software projects aren't successful. 70% to be exact. Out of these 20% are complete failures, and 50% are challenged (over time, outside budget, products nobody uses etc.) 

It's interesting to chew on these numbers - It means that for many of us, our software doesn't actually have a impact on an end user or organiszation in any way. The output of our work is just not used. This can be a hard pill to swallow for many developers. There are many aspects of any software product, and also many aspects that make it successful. What is it that we can do though?

I believe that if we as software developers can be part creating the right type of environment for software to be created, then we have a shot at making this better, and having more effective software development teams.

But how can we create this environment? 
Well, there a lot of things involved, but I think it can start small and start with ourselves, by making the mindset shift from ME to WE.

Let's see how making the shift from Me to We can help you as a software developer and increases the chances of creating something of value (TK)

## Focus on Outcomes
Outcomes aren't the same as the work you do, or the tasks you complete. They are the impact your decisions have. How the software effects end users. Are you making their lives easier? 

### Efficiency and Effectiveness
Being focused on outcomes is a sign of an Effective developer. In other words; Doing the right thing. Whereas an efficient developer is focused on doing the thing right. This may mean sacrificing your own personal efficiency, to allow the team to speed up.

> ME: I focus on my own efficiency

> WE: We are effective together

In many ways, the code you write and the work you do talks to efficiency. It's about the hard skills, and the quality of the work itself. For many this is where most of their time and focus is, rather that understanding the context of the work and how quality fits into the desired outcome.

Balancing these two traits is a challenge. You need to understand how to write the code, as well as how to do so in a way that allows software to have an impact for the people who need it.
