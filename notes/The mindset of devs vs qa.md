##Abstract / Summary
Throwing the story to the QA side of the wall

This blog post is about exploring the difference of mindset between the programming developer and the traditional tester. The thesis and idea is that being a developer means being able to take the work you create and move it across the board from a task in Jira to deployed in production. The idea is that A developer isn't going to be a great tester, and a tester isn't going to be a great developer. What we do want to promote is that 80% of tasks can sit on the fast track to production. For the rest of the tasks, that are more involved, a dedicated QA. Or an expert QA may be needed.

## Target Audience
The target audience is the development department working at Komplett Group. Now, there isn't anything unique about this specific bunch of developers, but I woul guess that most development teams with a dedicated QA department or role may be interested in this topic.

## Who is not in the target Audience
Development teams that carry their work all the way from dev to production.
