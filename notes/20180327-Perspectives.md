Originally a tweet-thread that didn't get pubblished:

I love the story of the movie "Inside Out". It shows how emotions grow and evolve as this young girl goes through hardships and discovers more of who she really is. But to do so, she needs to break down her old models of thought. 

She needs to acknowledge her past and use that as the fundament for her future. As with any children movie, the message applies equally to everyone., It just happens to be a a children's animation.

I've realised the value of pushing my limits. It's when I grow, break down previous misconceptions and learn more about myself. It's easy to get caught in the "cycle of growth" though. Pushing for the sake of pushing. Losing perspective.

Perspective isn't only about looking forward and having a bigger goal in mind. It's equally about acknowledging your past. Reminding yourself of what has brought you where you are. Without judgement. You can't change the past, but you can own it. It's yours alone.

This isn't to say that it should define you in any way, but rather allow you to acknowledge who you are as a person and what you need to do. Sometimes change in the present feels hard, and you wonder if it's worth it. But when putting the past into perspective, it's easier to see your trajectory. What may seems as a drastic change to you in the present is actually a nudge in the right direction.

I think being present with all we have is the most important thing we can do for ourselves and those around us. Have a strong moral compass. Learn from your past. Look forward to learn from your future. Don't dwell on either. The past has already happened. The future will be here soon enough. The only constant is "now".
