Some random thoughts on starting to build a software product.

- We want to build great products. This means different things to different people
- It doesn't mean getting it right the first time
- It does mean getting to a shared understanding of what the product means to the people using it, and their needs
- It's taking a vague idea or concept from a product owners head and gradually making sense of that idea as builders.
- It means rebounding that idea off current and potential users and allowing it to evolve along the way based on their feedback.

- Doing so by building out the product in unpolished iterations
- The problem with too much polish in the beginning is that it's just another form of "premature optimization". You don't know if you're building the right thing. Building it right is important, but building it wonderful should be done after you can be (more) confident it's the right thing. 
- At the same time, you need to show some polish so the product feels real. A bare minimum of styling and perhaps even behaviour around user feedback (information / error mesages / validation etc).

- With each iteration the look and feel of the product gradually improves. From being something rough, unfinished, barely functioning. Into a product that flows (hopefully). A product that users understand and appreciate, as it focuses on allowing them to get their work done.
- Initially these iterations can feel counter-productive. You see the product development isn't moving fast. 
- What's happening under the hood though is it starts to make its way into everyones heads. It solidifies and as this happens things start to change.

- To complete this loop, you need to get the initial version of the application to a state where you can actualy do a logical part of someones job. Meet a small need and get this in front of real users to gather feedback an initial thoughts.
- Ideally you should be feeling embarrassed about presenting the software like this. That's completely fine. User's feedback will guide you towards prioritising the next iteration.
- Feedback from 3-5 people should start to reveal the major pain-points that need to be adressed, and that should sail up the priority list.

- As you attend the needs of users, you'll start to get more and more personal / nuanced feedback, which is where the flow may change, and where polish really makes sense. Where are users feeling pain? What are they delklighted about?
- Look for ways of turning up what's already working.


At the end of the day, at the very core of building a product is something vulnerable. Something that is fragile that must be nourished and grown. It's feedback loops all the way, and working towards working iterations that nudge the product forward and tend to needs of the users. You can't fit that into a fixed time or fixed budget. You can do the best you can with the resources you have in hand and get the product to a place where it can solve real needs.

As long as you're listening, you'll know when you can stop and move on. You'll also know when you need to revisit and iterate based on new needs.
