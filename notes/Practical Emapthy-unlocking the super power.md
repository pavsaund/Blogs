Let me introduce you Dave. He's feeling excited, nervous, scared, giddy, but overall he's in a great mood. You see, it's his first day at his first ever job as a software developer. He walks into the office, makes the rounds and gets settled in. Dave's been given the assignment to set up his dev environment, and is hammering away on his machine, following the documentation. As he does this, he hears a frantic voice in the background: **“Prod is down”!** More voices chime in, and they realise Dave accidentally deleted production DB with the credentials in the documentation! The CTO pulls Dave into his office, and he stands there, awkward, terrified, embarrassed. He wants to explain what happened, it was an honest mistake after all. The CTO jumps in, says Dave has messed up everything and fires Dave on the Spot. Consider an alternative. At my first summer job, I worked in an aluminium factory around a casting production line. Part of my responsibility was to measure and add different mixtures of elements to the raw aluminum to create different alloys. One day I mixed up Magnesium (Mg), and Manganese (Mn). Instead of 2 kg of Mn, I added 200kg. The result was an unusable alloy-mixture, and a furnace with over a tonn of this alloy. The process of emptying the furnace, and removing the remnants took the better part of a week and and closed down that casting line - **I had broken production**, and was costing the company $100,000 a day in lost revenue. I was called in to my supervisors office. I stood there on the other side of his desk, awkward, terrified, embarrassed, ashamed. I wanted the explain myself but I couldn't find the words. He walked around his table, put a hand on my shoulder and asked if I was scared. I nodded. He told me that everything  was going to be ok. Then he sent me home and asked me to come back fresh the next day. I continued that summer, and for the next summers while I was studying as the responsible for production.

* * *

I didn't know it at the time, but what I was shown that day in my supervisors office was **empathy**.

## Empathy - a definition

There are many types of empathy, and several definitions. 2 types of empathy stand out, which are emotional and cognitive empathy. A definition that stands out is this one, from Theresa Wiseman, which was made popular in Dr. Brené Browns TED talk on the Power of Vulnerability.

> *   To see the world as others see it
> *   Understand another's current feelings
> *   Non-judgmental
> *   Communicate understanding back

**Seeing the world as others see it,** is a form of perspective taking. It's the ability to put yourself into another persons shoe's and understand the path they are travelling. **Understanding anothers current feelings, **implies that we first are able to understand what that other is going through. How it makes them feel, and be able to connect with a similar feeling within you. To be **non-judgemental**, means to acknowledge the perspective and feelings of the other. You don't have to agree with the feelings, but acknowledge and accepting they are what the other is experiencing. **Communicating understanding**. By reaching out and sharing your understanding you can confirm if you truly do understand or need to learn more. It also shows you are present and with the other in that moment.

## The Burnout

There was a time, during a very intense period at work and every day pressures at home with 2 children and a 3rd on the way, that it all became too much. I was overwhelmed and tired, which resulted in a 6 month leave of absence. Being completely burned out.

### The Project Meeting

Towards the end of a company-wide project involving many teams, my team was put on the spot one day. We were falling behind on our progress, and the go-live date was closing in. We were then presented with the option of voluntary overtime, and forced overtime. In the context of this meeting, I saw the free time with my family disappear, and a lot of extra pressure put on my pregnant wife. The result of this was an explosion in the meeting, of feeling alone, abandoned, and not heard at all.

I don't think i want to include this onw jhere.. it's just a painful source of... pain :) TK

## Cultivating Empathy

In my own journey, there are three main areas of focus I've found valuable to cultivate and grow my own capacity for empathy. Self-awareness, Listening and Perspective-taking. These are areas of focus anyone can spend time and effort to cultivate their empathyy skills

#### Introspection
Introspection is the act of becoming aware of yourself, your needs, and your own feelings. Understanding your strengths and weaknesses. There are many ways people acquire an awareness around themwelves. SOme practiee this through refelctive thoughts, othrs have been through experiences, and some do practices that help them on a day-to-day basis.

I fall into the camp of "what is this self-awareness thing, and why should I care?"! That said, there are two practives that have made an impact on me. Both for understanding the importance of self awareness, but also how to actually acquire it.

#### Self Empathy
In the book Non-Violent Communication by Marshal B Rosenberg, he writes about breaking down communication into 4 steps. TK, TK, TK and TK. These align quite well with the original definition of empathy, and it resonated with me. 

TK-NVC book cover image

What really made an impact though, is when he spoke about the value of empathy, and the importance of self-empathy. There's an underlying premise that you cannot show empathy to others unless you can do so for yourself first.

> "Self-Empathy in NVC means checking in with your own feelings and needs."

... and this is what I set out to do.

#### Mindfulness
Mindfulness is a form of meditation where the focus is be present in the TK TK TK TK TK. My wife introduced me to mindfulness, and when I sat there at home, with all the time in the world, I didn't have any excuses. It was time to start. 

> "The non-judgemental awareness of experiences in the present moment" TK-referance?

There's an overlap of this definition of mindfulness and the earlier introduced definition of empathy. REmoving judgement, being aware of experiences and needs, and listening to yourself and rying to understand yourself.

Relevance for software developers? When starting something new it can be easy to procrastinate, especially when there's a daunting task in front of you. Easily distracted. Spending a few minutes breathing, focusing on my breath and finding some calm allows to ease into flow state a lot easier.
Being present also helps when dealing with random needs and knee-jerk reactions coming in from the side. Dealing with disturbances. At least able to cach them. And keeping calm

#### Journaling

Journaling, the act of filling blank pieces of paper with my thoughts. IT allows clarity by emptying my mind. Also, seeing the words that are written help to reflect. Journal entries have a wonderful way of spawning off new, deper thoughts and reflections. Some have led to blog posts, while some blog posts have spawned off more journal entries.

TK enter facts about journaling.

Journaling itself is the act of reflecting and writing down those reflections. This isn't a new concept when it comes to our work places. We're aware of the practices of agile retrospectives, where we reflect on the work that's been done, and seek shared understanding with written words before learning and moving forward.

> "There are proven medical benefits of just thinking about the idea of swearing at your boss" - Kylie Hunt, a "Workplace Happiness Guru"

Taking a step back from this, it shows the value of having a private place to be completely honest and unfiltered with your thoughts, and having that safe place to deal with them.

An important, and hard part (for me) of journaling was to be completely unfiltered. Actually allowing my real feelings and thoughts to bubble passed my filters, and to get to the reactions underneath.

### Listening

#### To seek Understanding
During my time before the burnout, I remember having a lot of emotions, false expectations and a sense of being treated unfairly. My voice wasn't being heard. No one was listening. During my recovery period, someone from the company reached out to me and we started speaking together. He was wasn't looking to manage risks, or tick me off of a follow-up checkbox. He cared about me having the right tools to get back on my feet. I felt like someone wanted to hear what I had to say for the first time in a long time. The act of being listened to, instead of being told what to do created the basis for what was to be the a corner stone in my own healin process.

>"Don't just do something. Listen!"

Marshall B. Rosenberg writes in his book the importance of being present with another. How our natural mode of "taking action" is something to hold back. Sometimes all we need to do is to just be there, and listen.

As software developers this isn't easy. We are wired to see soltions, to solve problems and to approach things with an "I'm going to fix it mentality". 

#### Without Judgement
Now listening itself isn't really enough. It's a start, but our filters in our mind can sometimes be get the way. 
##### Breathing
One technique that helps is Breathing. When you are in a conversation, or a non-trivial discussion it's easy to feel emotions bubble up. Mindfulness helps here, with breathing, and being present.

##### Be Curious
Now there can be many reasons that you have these reactions, or emotions. It's often your own judgement and world view being applied onto anothers. To counter this, it helps to replace judgement with curiosity. Use irritation, as a trigger for curiosity. It's something you can't grasp, so be curious and find out what it is. "What is it I'm reacting to? What is it their saying that I'm not getting"?

##### Assume Good Intent
With any form of communication, it's natural that we pattern match and break down components based on our previous experiences. Sometims though this is just blocking us. Especially when the message is sent over a form of communication that doesn't convey body language or tone of voice. This could be in you team's chat. Over Skype. Or even someone shouting from another Room

>Kerth's Prime Directive
> "We agree that everyone has done the best job they could have done, given the knowledge, resources and their capabilitis...TKTKTKTKTK!"

I remeber sitting at a retrospective, ready to step through this sheet and reading the Prime Directive out loud. I said the words, then thought to myself...No! I don't believe everyone on the team actually did their best. There's that one guy...

In the moment it's easy get swept away and start ti judge, but if you take a step back you may see that most people are doing the best they really can. It's at the very core of Kerth's Prime Directive. Assuming good intent is powerful, but tbh it makes life a lot easier when having the deafult atttude that everyone is doing the best they can do.


#### To Connect
Now, this is someinth I struggle with. But it's taken me a while to realize that I struggle with it (TK sounds awful). 

#### Connecting with a feeling within you
With empaathy you talk about wanting to connect with a feeling within you. Trying to experience the same feelings. So in the example where my supervisor actually undertood what I was going through, he actually undertood because he had been through the same things. But if someone near me had lost a pet, I have no idea how that person is actually feeling since I've never owned or had a close relationship to a pet. What I Can do is be curious, ask how they are and try to get to the underlying feelings that person is feeling. Sadness, Joy, Disspair, a sense of loss? These are feelings I can connect to. Things that I can thenuse to find a similar space within myself.


### Perspective taking

### Challenge comfort zone

####Seek out different perspectives
Seeking out differt perspectives isn't always easy step to take. It often requires you to break out of your comfort zone.

When talking about frontend frameworks, Angular, Vew, React...they are realtively similar, and more straight forward to get to the fundamental differences. The differences in perspectives may be in regards to syntax, plugins, bindings, setup, but they all overlap the same fundamentals of building interactive javascript frontends and need to boil down to HTML, CSS and Javascript. So the jump to gain those perspective isn't that large.

When I got back from my six months of cutting the grass, I walked by the companies CEO and asked ig he had time for a short chat. He said that I could just find an opening in his calendar and book it. So I set up a 15 minute session and I was going to share my perspective and view of what had happened to me 6 months earlier. I wanted to get some kind of recognition for what I had been through, and the impact it had had on me. The 15 minute meeting turned into a 2 hour session. What I experienced was an understanding person on the other side of the table who listened, was curious, and dug deeper to understand. He then shared his own perspective, and where he wanted to take the company, the people within. He referred to the employees as his tribe. It was a great conversation between two individuals, not a CEO and his employee. 

I had always imagined management as those people who jiust don't get it. Pushing deadlines and demands downwards and making life harder for everyone. There was this line in my mind that created and us vs them scenario. A place where we were on the opposite side of certain aspects around how we did work. After meeting with our CEO, that line had become a lot thinner, and had started to blur. I gained some perspective in that conversation that allowed me to understand things differently. It was a lot easier to stay in my bubble, than seek out perspectives, and this changed everything.

But in our society, there are a lot of other aspects we just don't get. Things "other" groups of people do or say that conflict with my own world view. And looking for common ground is the first step towards understanding tha other perspective.

### Walk a mile in their shoes
Walking a mile in someone elses shoes. This is something anyone can do. It's practical and teaches you from direct experience. An example is when we are frustreated with our end users making demands, or complianing about the product. Or when they cant use it correctly. Taking time to sit with your users while they use your software can give you insights you weren't aware of.

One thing we struggled with on our team was handovers between our development cycle and the QA cycle afterwards. Our QA was struggling. he said it was hard to test our tasks and stories. So I suggested we try pairing up and I could join him. And we did this, and I realized that when the Jira ticket says "implement SQL", "Recreate the old way"..."How to test: should work as before". So I took that ticket. I couldn't open the code, or see the commits, and I had NO insight whatsoever into what was involved...I kind of understood where he was coming from in regards to struggling with stories to test.

Another thing to do is work in customer support. Be a part of their every day life trying to understand and help users, them trying to undertand the product. 

# Conclusion

> "Empathy is the key to undersanding" - Burnard P. (via Theresa Wiseman)

And what is it developers do day in, and day out? We try to understand problems, make sense of things. Rquirements, code, and communication.

## Human Connection Graph
The Human Connection graph is based on something Dr Brene Brown once said in an interview while she was explaining Empathy [TK LINK HERE]. According to her research, in a cultre of Shame and Blame, you cannot have meaningful human connection. When dailing up empathy, and allowing ourselves to be vulnerable we also allow those valuable human connections to be formed.

This is also reflected in the opening keynote where Matt Saginaki speaks about psychological safety in teams. When we come to work with our armour on, we don't allow ourselves to be vulnerable. We    can't have those conenctions, and we can't have a meaningful place to work.

So, allow yourselves to be vulnerable. As seniors on some level, we are role models and we have the opportunity to actually be vulnerable in our organizations, in our teams and in front of our colleagues. Giving them a safe space to be in, and allowing empathy to thrive.

## Road Slide [TK] Image
It's been a long journey for me to come to thi point. Through some quie painful experiences. Each and every one of you will have different experiences. Different needs, and different paths. This journey has shown me that I've been able to come from a place where empathy wasn't even on my radar. Now I find I can actually cultivate it for myself and those around me. Any steps you can take will make life better for you and hopefully for someone around you.

It helps blur the lines and build bridges.

## EMpathy as a Skill
You need to activly practice giving and receivng empathy. It's a skill that can be learned.
So practice!
* Look inwards, learn about yourself and your own reactions. Mindfulness and journaling are two possibiilities
* Try to actively Listen
* Gain perspectices.

These are things that we can do. But it takes effort. Because empathy is hard. it means fightting the reactive primtive mind.

Post by Seth Godin - Empathy is the hard part TK

This resonates with me. An important part to this is that it will wear you out. It akes effort. It becomes equally importatn with self awareness and personal boundaries. Realizing when it's enough.

## Empathy is a choice
Empathy is a choice. In the example of the young developer who got fired for making a mistake, the CTO had a choice. He chose...poorly. Empathy was not his first tool.
It's a choice, a vulnerable choice, and you are opening yourself up to connecting on a much deeper level. It's the first step from which you can find solutions you were previsuolsy not open to, or aware of. So i think we can all take small steps to make our worlds a better place for our colleaggues, families our friends.

All you need to do is begin with yourself, and allow empathy to be one of your guiding principles!
