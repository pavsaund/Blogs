Ask questions - don't question.
This is something that Gregory brown (@practicingdev) shared with me on twitter when I was quite honest and open about some things I was going through. He responded with a tweet sayign he hard head this distinction. Where you can Ask questions or you can question. Where Asking questions is helpful and productive and questioning is adversarial in nature.


When we apply our current understanding, we question.
When we seek to expand our current understanding we ask questions.

Questioning leads to conflict and negativity.
Asking questions builds bridges and is useful.

There's also something about the Growth Mindset here. What is the conclusion though? I don't know - i think that is the point. My world view isn't the absolute truth, but Seeking understanding vs confirming your own view should be the norm. It's through showing empathy we can bring our world views closer.

TK: This is something a lot closer to a blog post than the one yesterday. Still a lot of assumptions and "we".

Children ask all kinds of questions, some are profound, others are mundane. Why is the sky blue? Where does rain come from? What's for dinner? 
This curiosity is something that comes from an open mind. A beginners mind. Where the possibilities are endless and there are no expectations to know the answers. 

As we grow our understanding solidifies, our world view becomes more set, and the range of questions become a lot smaller. Our world view then starts to form hidden boundaries, or expectations. It acts as the laws for how we experience everything around us. Allowing us to make sense of impressions and move on with minimal effort. The more solid it is the easier it is for us to make sense of a situation.

What happens when your world view is challenged, though? It doesn't have to be anything profound, but something comes up that you don't understand? As I see it you have two choices. You apply your current understanding or you look for ways to expand your understanding.

We do the first automatically, without using any effort - "I love this code, you are awesome", "That design is great, I love how you solve things", "This feature is horrible, you write shitty code", "You should have done better, the user experience isn't good enough". When presented with a solution you question its validity and you can pass judgement as a result. You probe and prod at it with assumptions from your own perspective as you try to break the bubble and make it fit your world view. 

Expanding our understanding, though takes a lot more effort. You need to actively expand your own world view. It's about saying that you may not know something. Instead of questioning based on your assumptions, you seek out new understanding through asking questions around what you don't yet understand. "I wouldn't have written the code like this. Could you explain your thoughts behind this?", "The solution isn't taking these aspects of the user experience into consideration. Is there a reason for that?".
